# Jamie Eagle's Final Reflection 

###Initial Reflection
After being in the class for the last few months I was given the foundation to come up with a definition of digital humanities where 
I previously had none. My understanding of the digital humanities has been broadened after learning about other people’s interpretations 
and the definitions my classmates came up with over the semester. While my definition has changed somewhat as I’ve learned and grown, 
I’ve come up with a final definition to conclude the semester, though I know that my understanding will continue to develop.   

### Defining Digital Humanities
I define digital humanities as the synthesis of technology and traditional humanities, cultivated into an interactive, educational 
medium that brings a new perspective to the humanities that would not have been possible without the digital landscape. 
Initially I had a lot of difficulty in being able to differentiate what was simply a project done in a digital medium versus a 
digital humanities project, but now I feel that my idea has become much clearer.

### Reflecting on Readings
I found the readings to be helpful in my understanding of the digital humanities and the associated fields, 
along with the capabilities of its use as a bridge to other disciplines. I was mostly fond of the readings that gave real 
insight to the development of these projects and the different steps that one must follow in order to be successful rather 
than the ones that talked about conceptual ideas that went into the field - but that’s just my preference. Even the more conceptually 
based ones still provided something I could learn from even if they were not to my personal interest.   
 
My favorite reading for this semester was Hamilton’s Race, Politics, and Education in Tidewater Virginia. Anyone who has an 
understanding of gentrification can perceive that some historical circumstances led to the way the neighborhoods in Hampton Roads 
were made that way over the last century, but having this detailed written history to read was eye-opening to what exactly happened. 
I feel that there was something important in each one that should not be skipped in future classes, as they were each selected to 
help us learn the most about the subjects they tackled and they do so very well.   

###Projects and Assignments
While I did struggle somewhat in completing the assignments - this semester was something else entirely - I enjoyed the way they were 
designed to teach us many different parts of digital humanities all in one project. Each of them provided something unique and I was 
glad that for our final project we were able to choose practically any subject matter we preferred as long as it was important.   
 
I really enjoyed our first real blog assignment that allowed us to talk about our past experiences and what we hoped for, 
giving us a real first look into what the coding aspect of the class would be like. In fact each of the blogs were great assignments, 
I loved trying to figure out how the coding was supposed to work because I haven’t been exposed much to programming before, and having 
my images and links come up exactly as I wanted them to for the most part was fantastic.   
 
The final grant was a little bit of a struggle for me because my topic and the outcome I wanted for my project were so visually 
focused that my concept wasn’t exactly aligning with the given resources that were more for data-mapping and the like. However, 
being given the chance to explore with different programs and having the opportunity to write about why I think that my topic on 
anti-fashion would be important to research was very fun.

### Final Reflection
I believe that I’ve definitely grown as a digital humanist at the least, as I was not at all familiar with the concept before this 
class. Now that I’ve learned so much I can see many possibilities in my field where digital humanities projects can be implemented.   
 
As a reader and writer I felt very confident and comfortable in my abilities before this class, having the chance to flex those 
muscles with the assignments and projects was a good opportunity, especially in writing about something that was completely unfamiliar 
to me prior to this semester. Being able to analyze these topics and compose something about my assessment of them was good practice 
and I feel far more confident in at least being able to make a statement about this field. Overall, the class was very in-depth and 
informative, and I am grateful to have been enrolled in it for the semester.
