***Jheronimus Bosch, the Garden of Earthly Delights***, is a digital humanities project that takes the viewer on an interactive tour through
the most famous triptych of Northern Renaissance artist Jheronimus Bosch. The digital body of work was led under the direction of 
Pieter van Huijstee, who guided the incorporation of narration from the documentary film Hieronymus Bosch, Touched by the Devil, 
which he also created. A supplementary [website](http://jheronimus-bosch.nl/#) explaining the background of the project can be explored to further understand his vision. This transmedia piece is of much benefit to all viewers, as this triptych is not currently on viewable display.
The combination of narration, supplementary text, and the ability for the viewer to magnify onto the deepest details of the piece allow
for a unique exploration into the intricate scenes of Northern Renaissance religious and cultural symbolism that they would not find anywhere else.

The interactive project is accessible in-browser on a desktop or laptop computer, and also on mobile devices - although the website itself warns 
mobile users that the interactivity has improved functionality on a desktop. Navigating the website itself was simple enough as scrolling through 
the painting and clicking on bookmarked locations of interest for the documentary to begin explaining the areas the viewer had chosen. Immediately
a closeable transcript of the audio would appear in an easy to read font, and an audio player would show the length of the audio with a pause or close
button to cease the narration at any point. Any information sought by the viewer was easily accessible as many clearly labeled tabs would drop from the 
top of the webpage if the viewer used their mouse to search for them. On mobile, these tabs were ever present, although made more transparent to avoid
distraction from the painting. For an individual with audio/visual disabilities, I believe that the provided audio and transcripts would be sufficient
for easy navigation throughout the website.

The audio sourced from Hieronymus Bosch, Touched by the Devil, is available in both English and Dutch, with narration by Redmond O’Hanlon and Midas Dekkers
respectively. A version for Dutch speaking children is also available by selecting a secondary tab under languages. These audio experiences may be played in
any order as the viewer sees fit, navigating freely through the piece, but the website also provides the option to play in order of highlights. The highlight
tour depicts fifteen of the most central aspects of The Garden of Earthly Delights that would be of key interest to an individual seeking the most basic but important information. 
The visual component itself is unobtrusive and flows smoothly as it magnifies one area after another to prevent vertigo or distortion of the work itself. The animation of the triptych
panels opening and closing as the tour moves to the outer panels of the work is also smooth and non-disruptive or jarring. In my opinion, the visual details of the piece are clean and
easily translatable to a digital screen with the only loss being the ability to look at a physical plane of the work to observe technical details such as brushstrokes - however the
goal of this project leaves what has been made available a sufficient amount for the viewer to tour.  

There is also a matter of the supplementary audio, being chattering noises of animals and raucous people along with some music in certain sections. These noises may add to the visual 
story of the artwork as a highly compact, overwhelming work of mystery, but there is no option to turn off this component of the project unless the narration is speaking. I feel this detracts 
from the project in terms of its capabilities, but I’m sure the creators were working under the understanding that the viewer may simply mute the audio of the device they are using to peruse the project.  

Overall, the project is well-designed and well-run with no apparent issues to the technicalities necessary for the website to function properly.
