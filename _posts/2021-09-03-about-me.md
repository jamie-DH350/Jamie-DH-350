# Jamie Eagle's Exploration of The Digital Humanities
My name is Jamie Eagle, I use they/them pronouns, and I am a senior Art History major and Museum Studies minor at [Christopher Newport University](www.cnu.edu).
Following my graduation in the spring of 2022 I will begin working towards my masters in museum studies from George Washington University. 
I’m seeking to work in collections management with the goal of making museum collections more accessible and bringing these institutions closer to the digital world. 

I’ve quickly learned that museum professionals can no longer get by without some digital expertise. After taking some introductory coding classes and a digital media course, 
I’m hoping this digital humanities course will help bridge the gap between my understanding of traditional humanities and digital humanities. 

### In The Collections...
During the summer of 2021 I worked on my first official digital project with the [Guinea Heritage Association](http://www.guineaheritage.org/guinea-talk/) and [Buck’s Store Museum](http://www.guineaheritage.org/museum/). 
There, I learned about the culture and dialect of the Guinea watermen through the digitization of oral histories and transcript writing, and was able to create educational resources to enlighten the public about their rich community. 

My goal for this semester is to work with the Mariner’s Museum & Library and the Watermen’s Museum to complete and publish 
a digital humanities exhibition project on the Guinea watermen’s oystering economy as the provider of the largest source of oysters for the United States. 

My central focus, however, is to make the arts and humanities more accessible for the public. I’ve been lucky enough that this ideal aligns with that of 
Christopher Newport University and the Torggler family, and I have been able to make the [Torggler Fine Arts Center](https://thetorggler.org/) my second home as internship manager. 
The past year my fellow interns and I have been preparing the center for university and museum classes, exhibiting student works, and hope to bring our first large-scale loaned exhibition to the public in October 2021. 

### The Passion in Humanities

Over the past few years I've had several exciting hands-on experiences with the humanities.  
* Working onstage and off-stage on an [opera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGRdAASo_q0),

* several musicals,

* a play festival,

* And I’ve taken a digital photography course!

These experiences have given me true passion for the arts and humanities in all of its forms. I’ve learned and grown and created beautiful projects with many fascinating people. 
I hope to continue expanding my worldview through many disciplines. 

### Away From it All

Some may expect a blog like this to keep to a formal style akin to a resume that lists out my expertise and experiences, 
but the “smaller” parts of my life keep me on track and keep me interested in everything that I do. 

My friends and I get together and play tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. We go thrifting for sustainable fashions. 
When I need peace to myself I look through my collection of playbills and magazines to find interesting images to make collages out of. 

All of the above interests I’ve described have had their hand in larger scale projects my friends and I have done for thesis research on 
the connection between TTRPG’s and a LGBT identity, to making online graphics to share information on sustainable living to fight fast-fashion. 

The arts and humanities touch every part of our lives and I hope that through these small meaningful parts of mine you’ll be able to recognize the passion in yourself as well.
